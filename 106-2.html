	<p><h2>Principal's Desk</h2><br>"Whatever you do in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord, giving thanks to Him" â€“was the ethos of life of our founder late Padma Bhushan Karamshibhai Jethabhai (K. J.) Somaiya. His pioneering efforts and hard work not only revolutionized the sugar industries but his balanced perspective and the social bent of mind enabled him in furthering his dream of shaping young minds through quality education. Shri K. J. Somaiya laid the foundation for Somaiya Vidyavihar Trust in 1959, which then established the K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE) in 1983.</p>
